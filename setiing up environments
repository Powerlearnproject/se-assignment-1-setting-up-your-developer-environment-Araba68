### Q1. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
## VSCODE INSTALLATION GUIDE
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor developed by
Microsoft. It's designed to be highly customizable and extensible, catering to a wide range of
programming languages and development workflows.Visual Studio Code has a high productivity code editor which, when combined with programming language services, gives you the power of an IDE and the speed of a text editor.
Vscode has many interesting features that makes it one of the most useful and probably easy to use text editor. Below are some of the features associated with vscode:
a)	Cross platform: VS Code is a free code editor, which runs on the macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems. Vscode is also  lightweight as we have mentioned above,  and should run on most available hardware and platform versions.
b)	Language Support: It offers built-in support for numerous programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++, and many more. Additionally, you can install extensions to enhance support for specific languages.
c)	IntelliSense: VS Code provides intelligent code completion, syntax highlighting, and code suggestions, helping you write code faster and with fewer errors.
d)	Integrated Terminal: It comes with a built-in terminal, allowing you to run commands, compile code, and perform other tasks without leaving the editor.
e)	Debugger: VS Code includes a debugger for various languages, enabling you to debug your code directly within the editor.
f)	Version Control: It offers built-in Git integration, allowing you to perform version control operations such as committing, pulling, pushing, and resolving merge conflicts without switching to a separate Git client.
g)	Extensions: VS Code's functionality can be extended through a vast ecosystem of extensions available in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. These extensions add support for new languages, provide additional tools, and enhance your overall development experience.

h)	Customization: You can personalize almost every aspect of VS Code to suit your preferences. This includes themes, keyboard shortcuts, settings, and more.

## VSCODE SETUP AND CONFIGURATIONS
Since I am using a windows 10 OS, let me show you how to install and configure the text editor on my machine. The steps are as follows”
•	First, Download the Vscode installer by visiting their official Visual Studio Code website (https://code.visualstudio.com/) using your web browser. Click on the "Download for Windows" button to download the installer file.
•	Installer: Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded installer file (usually in your Downloads folder as VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe) and double-click on it to run it. It will take a few minutes to run the wizard installer 
 











 








 

.You can choose the installation location and whether to add VS Code to your PATH (environment variables) during the installation process

 
 

•	The Visual Studio Code installer will create an icon in the start Menu. To locate it, click on the Start Menu and search for 'vsCode':
NB: 1. VS Code provides both Windows user and system level setups.

The user setup does not require Administrator privileges to run as the location will be under your user Local AppData (LOCALAPPDATA) folder. Since it requires no elevation, the user setup is able to provide a smoother background update experience. This is the preferred way to install VS Code on Windows.
2. The system setup requires elevation to Administrator privileges to run and will place the installation under the system's Program Files. The in-product update flow will also require elevation, making it less streamlined than the user setup. On the other hand, installing VS Code using the system setup means that it will be available to all users in the system.

And that is how you successfully install vscode on a windows machine. You can now add extensions depending on your needs.
### Q2.  Set Up Version Control System: Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com
First of all let’s define version control system(vcs). Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.
We have several industry approved vcs’s such as Apache subversion, Mercurial, Perfoce, Git just to mention a few. I am going to show you how to download, install and configure Git as this is the most common used vcs.
## GIT INSTALLATION AND GUIDE
What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control source code by programmers collaboratively developing software. Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.
. Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed:
•	Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
•	Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
•	Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.


## GIT SETUP

a)	First, download git for windows on your browser by using the  link:  https://git-scm.com/download/win and the download will start automatically.
b)	Then follow the installation wizard as depicted on the pictorial representations below

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•	After the installation wizard has completed installing git, you can check it by searching “git” from your search panel.
•	Before using your git, you first need to configure a few parameters such as user-name, default branch and email as follows:
NB: We interact with git using Git bash IDE. So, open Gitbash and run it as administrator  to have the root privileges that come along with the Git



 

 

 

 

There are a few commands that are imperative to interacting with Git such as 
	git init  - for initializing a repository
	git status  - to know the status of your repositor
	git add “filename” – to track a file or adding that to the staged environment
	git commit -m “message”  - commiting files to the repository
	git log – to show all the commits made

That is how you setup and configure git on your windows pc
### Q3. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes: Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.


## PYTHON SETUP
1.	The first step is to download python using  the browser on your pc by typing the following link: https://www.python.org
2.	Download python’s latest version for windows and follow the steps on the wizard as shown by the diagrams below:
 

 

 
3.	Check for the environment where the python has been installed by searching “environment variables” on your search pane. Note that if the python has not been added to the path you have to add it manually.
 
 
 


## Q3. Install Package Managers: If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
Installing package managers like pip depends on the operating system and whether python is already installed. Below are simple steps on how to install pip (python ) on your machine:
PIP SETUP

1.	Install python  from the original website using the link: www.python.org
2.	Run the installer and make sure you add python to the PATH


 
3.Verify python installation by opening CMD and type : python --version

### Q4. Configure a Database (MySQL): Download and install MySQL database.
Mysql is a platform that lets you create databases for your project. A complete mysql set up consists of a mysql client where the user interacts with the mysql server which serves as the key component in storing, retrieving and managing data. The following steps will guide you on how to install and configure  mysql on your pc:
•	The first step is to download Mysql server using the link: https://dev.msql.com/downloads.installer/
•	After download is complete, begin the installation process by locating where the download file is and double click on it
•	Now follow on the installation wizard. On “choosing set up” select “server only” as we need the server first so as to interact with the client.

 

•	 
 
•	On type and networking  make sure you select “Development computer” and select a port number. By default we always use “3306”as the default port. Make sure you also click on “show advanced and logging options” to unhide the other essential steps.
 





•	On the authentication method, click on the recommended option that allows you the user to always use a password whenever you are using mysql
 
•	On windows service check the appropriate boxes and leave everything as it is. You can configure the windows service name to any that you see fit
 




•	On “server file permission” check the first option 
 
•	On logging options configure your username as you want it to appear on your mysql command line
 





•	On advanced options let server ID be as default and check the first option under “Table names
 
•	Ëxecute and let it run for a few minutes
 

 

 
Now that we are done with the installation wizard , the next step is to initiate Mysql server for the first time in your pc. To do that, run CMD as an administrator to and type”
“C:\Program Files \MySQL \MySQL Server 8.0 \bin \mysqld” –console
Once this command is complete we now have Mysql server running. So the next step is to install Mysql workbench from Microsoft. This is the environment a user interacts it when querrying requests from the Mysql server.
### Q5. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional): Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

### Q6. Explore Extensions and Plugins: Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

## IDE EXTENSIONS

You can install various extensions in your vscode depending on your needs. For you to download and install extensions;
•	Open vscode
•	Toggle to the extensions icon found on the left side of your vscode margin
•	Click on the icon and once open search on the particular extension you need e.g dart

Document Your Setup: Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process.
